## What is this?

When you see a German license plate, the first few letters indicate which city or district it's registered in. This app lets you search and explore over 700 license plate codes to find out where they're from.

Features:
- **Fast search**: Type any letters to filter and find matching codes
- **Interactive map**: View locations on a map of Germany
- **Area codes**: The number placeholder (123) shows approximate area codes for each region
- **Track progress**: Mark codes you've seen to keep track of which ones you recognize

The area codes are mapped from multiple datasets and may not be 100% accurate, but they add a bit of authenticity to the license plate display.

## Development

```bash
cd kennzeichen-app
